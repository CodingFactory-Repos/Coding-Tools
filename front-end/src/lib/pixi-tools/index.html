	<p>The Scene class is the main entry point of this library. It is responsible for creating and managing a hierarchy of DisplayObjects, which are the visual elements that make up the scene.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Add, remove, and access DisplayObjects in the scene</li>
	<li>Set the size and position of the Viewport</li>
	<li>Set the size and spacing of cells in the Grid</li>
	</ul>
