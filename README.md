# Coding-Tools

ðŸ”¬ - School-project about tools to manage better in the school 

## Explainations 

This Repository is supposed to be the result of a project that we have to realize in one or two years of study and whose goal is to create a tool to manage students and teachers in agile scrum

## Installation
To install and use this project, you will need Node.js and npm (which are usually installed together) on your computer.

1. Download or clone the git repository to your computer.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the `front-end` folder and install the project dependencies using the command `npm install`.
3. In another terminal, navigate to the `back-end` folder and also install the dependencies using the command `npm install`.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the back-end server using the command `npm start` in the `back-end` folder.
5. In the `front-end` folder, start the app using the command `npm start`. This should open a browser window with the app running.

If everything went well, you should now be able to use the app. Note that you may need to modify the back-end server settings (such as the address and port) in the `front-end/src/config/config.js` file based on your configuration.
