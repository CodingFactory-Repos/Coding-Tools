# Security Policy

## Protecting Sensitive Data

We take measures to protect sensitive data, such as personal or financial information of our users. We encrypt this data when it is transmitted over our network and when it is stored on our servers.

As an open source project, we publish the source code of our software on a public GitHub repository. We do not publish sensitive data in this repository.

## Detecting and Managing Data Breaches

We use data breach detection tools to constantly monitor our systems and detect any suspicious activity. If a data breach is detected, we immediately take steps to limit the damage and inform affected users.

In case of a data breach, we will publish a security notice on our GitHub repository and on our website, along with instructions for users to protect their data.

## Data and System Access Policies

We have strict access policies that govern who can access data and systems in our organization. All users must be authenticated and authorized before they can access data or systems.

As an open source project, we open our source code to all users. However, access to sensitive data and production systems is limited to members of our development team.

## Protecting Against Cyber Attacks

We take measures to protect our systems against cyber attacks, such as setting up firewalls and antivirus software. We also constantly monitor our systems for suspicious activity.

In case of a cyber attack, we will take necessary measures to protect our systems and data, and inform affected users. We will also work with relevant authorities to investigate the attack and identify the perpetrators.

## Maintaining System and Data Security

We regularly update our software and operating systems to maintain the security of our systems and data. We also have backup procedures in place to ensure the security of data in case of an issue.

If you have any questions or concerns about the security of our systems or data, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are always available to answer your questions.
