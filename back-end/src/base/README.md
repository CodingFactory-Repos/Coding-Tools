## Base folder definition

The purpose of the base folder is to provide a central location for defining the core abstractions that are used throughout the application.
By defining these abstractions in a central location, it is possible to provide a consistent foundation for the different parts of the application and to ensure that they all share a common set of core concepts and behaviors. This can help to improve the organization and maintainability of the framework.
Although in our case, the base folder `does not contains external module or authentification modules`, those fall outside the range of features.
