## Helper folder definition

The helper folder is typically a directory that contains code and other resources that are used to assist the different components of the framework.
This might include utility classes, functions, and other pieces of reusable code that are used to perform common tasks or operations within the framework
Think of them as simple and efficient algorythm.

They fall into these categories : 

- Object manipulation
- Object cleanup (ie. _pick from lodash)
- Object conversion
- Array manipulation
- Array reducer
- Array concatenation
- Mapping with options (sort)
- String manipulation
- Token buffer generator
- UUID generator
- Password validator
- Hasher
- ...

You get the drill.
