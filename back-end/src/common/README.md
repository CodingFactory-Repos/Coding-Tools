## Common folder definition

The common folder is typically a directory that contains files and code that are shared among different parts of the framework.
This might include utility classes, functions, and other pieces of reusable code that are used in multiple places within the framework.
The common folder might also contain configuration files, global variables, and other resources that are needed by multiple components of the framework.
The purpose of the common folder is to provide a central location for storing and accessing shared code and resources, which can help to improve the organization and maintainability of the framework.
