## Decorator definition

A decorator is a design pattern that is used to add additional functionality to an existing object without modifying the object itself.
This is achieved by wrapping the original object with a decorator object, which provides the additional functionality.
They are often used in backend APIs to provide additional functionality to existing objects or classes, such as adding logging, caching, or authentication capabilities. 
They improve the flexibility and extensibility of an API by allowing new functionality to be added without modifying the existing codebase.
